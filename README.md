A screenshot-like mockup of a web-based terminal emulator resembling Gotty, displayed on a browser window. The terminal shows a simple Bash shell interface with a black background and white text, including common commands like 'ls' and 'pwd'. The browser frame includes a visible address bar with a generic URL like 'http://localhost:8080', and minimalistic browser UI elements. The design is clean and modern, suitable for a README file.
